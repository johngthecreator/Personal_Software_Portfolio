# Overview

I created an app that counts down from when the next sunset will occur.

Users will allow access to their location and that will be sent to an api that will return the specific time that the sunset will occur in their area.

I created this app because I wanted to promote wholesome activities that individuals could do with their friends or loved one.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used consist of React Native, Expo, and Axios as the http client.

The environment I used was VSCode and the Expo Go app to test the app locally.

# Useful Websites

* [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/)
* [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

# Future Work

* I want to design a better UI so that it's more useable.
* I want to add local storage so that users can save their location.
* I want to add support for more regions.
