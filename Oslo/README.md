# Overview

## Oslo Medic

[Link to live Github Repo](https://github.com/johngthecreator/oslomedic)

Oslo is a web application that I wrote utilizes an open-source API hosted by Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications that returns information on common medication. My hope by creating this web application is that individuals will be able to track medication interactions of the medications that they're taking. I wrote the project in Next.js and TypeScript.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode as my IDE with the Vim extension.

I used create-next-app to scaffold the project. Refer to the tsconfig file for specific settings.

# Future Work

- I would like to implement better design in the project with an emphasis on mobile design.
- I want to implement a different way to fetch the data, potentially utilizing something like Axios.
