# Overview

The program that I wrote utilizes an open-source API hosted by Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications that returns information on common medication. In addition I also wrote a simple recursive function that adds the number within an array.

I wrote this program in an attempt to utilize the object-oriented nature of TypeScript to more effectively organize my code and access APIs. The reason for writing the recursive function was not only to understand how to construct a basic algorithm in TypeScript but also to test the efficiency of this algorithm against the map() function.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode as my IDE with the Vim extension.

I utilized NodeJS with the TypeScript packaged installed as a dependency. Refer to the tsconfig file for specific settings.

# Future Work

- I would like to implement the recursive algorithm to run the method over the array of medications.
- I want to implement a different way to fetch the data, potentially utilizing something like Axios.
