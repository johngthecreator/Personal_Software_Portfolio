# Overview

This Hello World Project was a test project to ensure that my repository was properly set up and cloned onto my local machine.

This project is a simple python program that prints out "Hello World" with a little twist.

The main objective of this project was to ensure that I properly set up my remote repository on Github and that it's properly connected to my local machine.
